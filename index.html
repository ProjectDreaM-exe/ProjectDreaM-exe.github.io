<h1>Hello</h1>
<p>

This is just a small page made for updating people on projects We at Project_DreaM are working on (yes, only one github user is a part, however multiple users are currently using that one account).

This is completely useless to anyone who isn't actively benefitting from our work, so if you don't get anything from what we're doing, just wait. We'll get to you soon.

Our current project is a way to bypass some of the website security blocks our current test school,[REDACTED], has set up in an attempt to deter students from playing on school devices(or even personal devices, as most schools have a wifi-based filter AND a device filter).

If we succeed, we will find a way to give out the methods we used so others can use similar methods.

If you go to the school we're testing on, congratulations. you'll likely be obtaining tricky websites that are entertaining without being blocked as soon as we believe it's ready to be given out.

you are benefitting from our work and we don't need you to do anything but use the main website and the external websites attatched to it

Thank you for your participation.

I am N1G1-1TM4R3, and I'm off to go continue progress on this project.
